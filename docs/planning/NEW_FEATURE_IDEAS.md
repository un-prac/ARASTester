# NEW FEATURE IDEAS

This file explains possible next features for ARASTester in plain language for someone who has never worked on this project before.

## What is ARASTester (in simple terms)?

ARASTester is a desktop tool that helps teams test ARAS Innovator without writing code for every check.

Think of it like this:

- You create a **test plan** (a checklist of steps).
- Each step is an **action** (for example: connect to ARAS, query an item, verify a field value).
- You run the plan and see pass/fail results.

Today, the app already supports many ARAS operations. The codebase has recently been modularized (partitioning the Electron main process and separating domain gateway responsibilities on the C# backend) to serve as a clean and robust foundation. The ideas below are about leveraging this modern architecture to make testing easier, safer, and more scalable for real teams.

---

## Before the feature list: a beginner mental model

When people test ARAS manually, they usually do this:

1. Open ARAS.
2. Search or edit records.
3. Check expected behavior.
4. Repeat for many variations.

ARASTester automates that repetitive process.

So every new feature should answer one of these beginner questions:

- Can I run tests faster?
- Can I trust the results more?
- Can I understand failures quickly?
- Can my whole team use this safely?

## 1) Data-Driven Test Runs

### What this feature is
Run the same test many times with different input data (for example, 200 part numbers from a file), instead of cloning the same test again and again.

### Why beginners care
Without this feature, a new user might create 50 similar tests manually and get overwhelmed. Data-driven runs keep one clean test flow and feed many input rows into it.

### Real-life example
You want to verify that all "Released" parts in a list have valid lifecycle state, owner, and lock status.

- Without data-driven runs: 1 test per part (very repetitive).
- With data-driven runs: 1 test template + dataset file.

### User value
- Less duplication.
- Faster regression testing.
- Easier updates (change one test, not 50).

---

## 2) Conditional Branching + Retry

### What this feature is
Let tests make decisions during execution:

- "If this condition is true, do path A; otherwise do path B."
- "If this step fails due to temporary issue, retry a few times."

### Why beginners care
New users often assume automation is always linear, but real systems are not. ARAS responses can vary by state, permissions, or timing. Branching and retry make tests behave more like real operator logic.

### Real-life example
If a workflow activity is not yet available, wait and retry instead of failing immediately.

### User value
- Fewer false failures.
- Better handling of real-world timing issues.
- Tests become smarter, not just longer.

---

## 3) Run History + Rich Reports

### What this feature is
Store run results over time and allow easy report export (human-readable and shareable).

### Why beginners care
When someone asks, "Did we test this release?" you need proof. Beginners especially struggle when they can only see the latest run and lose context.

### Real-life example
A QA lead wants a weekly summary:

- What passed?
- What failed repeatedly?
- Which tests became slow?

### User value
- Better visibility.
- Better communication with non-technical stakeholders.
- Faster debugging because older failures are traceable.

---

## 4) Baseline Snapshot + Difference Checking

### What this feature is
Save a known-good result (baseline), then compare future runs to it automatically.

### Why beginners care
A beginner may only verify one or two fields and miss subtle changes. Snapshot comparison highlights all meaningful differences.

### Real-life example
After an ARAS configuration change, a query result still "works" but returns extra/changed fields. Snapshot diff reveals that silent drift.

### User value
- Detects hidden regressions.
- Increases confidence after upgrades/migrations.
- Makes "what changed?" clear.

---

## 5) Safety Guardrails for Dangerous Actions

### What this feature is
Certain actions (like raw SQL or raw AML execution) are powerful and risky. Guardrails define what is allowed in each environment.

### Why beginners care
Beginners may not realize risk boundaries and can run destructive commands accidentally. Guardrails protect data and systems.

### Real-life example
In a production-like environment, destructive queries should be blocked by default.

### User value
- Safer defaults.
- Reduced operational risk.
- Better trust when onboarding new testers.

---

## 6) Tags + Dependency-Aware Runs

### What this feature is
Organize tests with tags (like "smoke", "workflow", "file") and dependencies (Test B should run only if Test A passes).

### Why beginners care
As test suites grow, new users get lost. Tags and dependencies turn a flat list into structured, meaningful execution.

### Real-life example
Before a release, run only smoke tests. For nightly runs, execute full suite with dependency order.

### User value
- Faster targeted runs.
- Better suite organization.
- Clearer failure impact (what got skipped and why).

---

## 7) Headless CLI + CI Pipeline Mode

### What this feature is
Run test plans from command line/pipelines without opening the desktop UI.

### Why beginners care
Teams eventually want scheduled or release-gated automation. UI-only tools limit scaling.

### Real-life example
Every night at 2 AM, pipeline runs selected plans and publishes report artifacts.

### User value
- Automated quality gates.
- No manual clicking needed.
- Better integration with team delivery process.

---

## 8) Reusable Plan Fragments

### What this feature is
Create reusable mini-blocks of test logic (for example: login setup, common assertions) and reuse them across many plans.

### Why beginners care
New users often copy-paste setup actions repeatedly. Reusable fragments remove repeated boilerplate.

### Real-life example
A standard "Connect + Validate Session + Warmup Query" block can be shared across all plans.

### User value
- Less repetition.
- Easier maintenance.
- More consistent test quality across team.

---

## Suggested beginner-first roadmap

If the goal is fastest practical value for a new team, start in this order:

1. Run History + Reports.
2. Data-Driven Runs.
3. Retry + Branching.
4. Tags + Dependency-Aware Runs.
5. Safety Guardrails.
6. CLI + CI mode.
7. Snapshot Difference Checking.
8. Reusable Fragments.

This order is designed for clarity first, then scale, then advanced power features.

## Simple glossary (no prior context assumed)

- **ARAS**: The PLM system this app tests.
- **Test Plan**: A file containing tests.
- **Test**: A group of steps.
- **Action**: One step (query, create, assert, etc.).
- **Assertion**: A check that should pass/fail.
- **Regression Testing**: Re-running tests to ensure old behavior still works after changes.
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline that builds/tests software.
- **Headless**: Running without a user interface.
